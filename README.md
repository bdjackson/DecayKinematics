DecayKinematics
===============
This is a small package to compute the kinematics of a particle decaying. For example, if a particle is at rest, and undergoes a 2-body decay, the kinematics of the daughters will be fully defined.

The package should also be able to boost the mother particle, and compute the extreme values for the daughter particles' momenta.
